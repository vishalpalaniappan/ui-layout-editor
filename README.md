# ui-layout-editor
This tool allows you to visually create layouts and export a LDF file that can be used by the ui-layout-manager. 

As part of creating the layout by splitting the ui into rows and columns using dividers, the user will also be able to specify custom properties for each container. This includes properties like minimum width, tabs, color scheme, container id, component names etc. 

This editor will use the ui-layout-manager to generate the layout for this application, so it will be implemented after the minimum required features are added to the ui-layout-manager (layout, resizeable containers, component injection, layout caching etc).
